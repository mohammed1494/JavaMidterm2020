interface can have only abstract methods

Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ? No, you would have to implement the object
what is Access Specifier? an access specifier is used to set the accessibility of classes
What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP. Object Oriented Programming
abstract- a method without any body
encapsulation - used to hide data
inheritance - used in order to get properties of other classes
polymorphism - object takes on various methods

What is Java Package and which package is imported by default? java package is used in order to
organize related classes. Java.lang package is default

What is method overloading and when it happens? Method Overloading allows a class to have more than one method having the same name different paramters

Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it. An exception is an event, which occurs during the execution of a program, you
can handle it by using exception handling

What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ? static is a non access modifier

What is the difference between JDK and JVM?
JDK is a software development kit, JVM is an environment for executing bytecode

What is the difference between JVM and JRE?
JRE is a software bundle that allows Java program to run JVM is an environment for executing bytecode
What is compile time and run time? compile time is when program is compiled, runtime is when the program executes
What is heap? place in memory to store objects
How java manage it's memory? by allocating it in the heap
What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?
Strings are immutable, and objects of StringBuffer and StringBuilder are mutable.
StringBuilder is faster than StringBuffer

What is Singleton class? class that can only have one object

What is Serialization and Deserialization?

Serialization is a mechanism of converting the state of an object into a byte stream. Deserialization is the reverse process

when to use transient variable in java? The transient keyword in Java is used to avoid serialization

Difference between while and do..while loop?

Why is String Immutable in Java? because it is cached in the string pool and wont be changed

What is constructor chaining in Java? use of multiple constructors

The difference between Serial and Parallel Garbage Collector?
The main difference between them is that a serial collector is a default copying collector which uses only one GC thread for garbage
collection while a parallel collector uses multiple GC threads for garbage collection.

What is JIT stands for? just in time
Explain Java Heap space and Garbage collection?
heap is used to store objects, garbage collection gets rid of unused objects

Can you guarantee the garbage collection process?
no, it is dependent on the space
What is the difference between stack and heap in Java?
Heap memory is used by all the parts of the application whereas stack memory
is used only by one thread of execution. Whenever an object is created,
it's always stored in the Heap space and stack memory contains the reference to it.



What is reflection in java and why is it useful? look into classes at runtime
allows for creativity

concurrent execution of two or more parts of a program.

What is the use of synchronization in Java?
 used to provide exclusive access to a shared resource
 with multiple threads in Java

What is Framework? pre-written code

What are the testing Framework available in java? Jbehave, JUnit , testNG

Difference between jUnit and testNG?
JUnit is an open-source framework used to trigger and write tests.
TestNG is a Java-based framework that is an upgraded option for running tests


What are the dependencies for this project?
mysql-connector 8.0

what is dependency injection in java?
 objects get other required objects from outside

What is static binding and dynamic binding?
Static binding happens at compile-time while dynamic binding happens at runtime.
